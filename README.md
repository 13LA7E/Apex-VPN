## RequirementsüáÆüá≥ **Tailscale VPN Setup for Codespaces**



- GitHub Codespaces environmentThis repository provides automated Tailscale setup for GitHub Codespaces, allowing you to access your India-based resources securely.

- Tailscale account with authentication key

- Root/sudo access for network configuration## üöÄ Quick Start

- Minimum 2GB RAM for optimal performance

### Method 1: Manual Start (Immediate)

## Configuration```bash

./start-tailscale.sh

The VPN client automatically detects and configures:```



- Available CPU cores for process affinity optimization### Method 2: Auto-start with Terminal

- Memory allocation for network buffers based on available RAMAdd to your `~/.bashrc`:

- DNS resolver configuration based on system capabilities```bash

- Network interface optimization parametersecho "source /workspaces/India-VPN/tailscale-bashrc-addition.sh" >> ~/.bashrc

```

## Troubleshooting

### Method 3: Service-like Management

### Connection Issues```bash

chmod +x tailscale-service.sh

```bash./tailscale-service.sh start    # Start daemon

# Check daemon status./tailscale-service.sh status   # Check status

./india-vpn status./tailscale-service.sh stop     # Stop daemon

```

# Run comprehensive diagnostics

./india-vpn test## üìÅ Files Included



# Restart with clean state- **`start-tailscale.sh`** - Main startup script

./india-vpn restart- **`setup-tailscale-codespace.sh`** - Initial setup (installs Tailscale if needed)

```- **`tailscale-service.sh`** - Service management script

- **`tailscale-bashrc-addition.sh`** - Bash profile addition

### Performance Issues- **`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`** - Auto-setup for new codespaces



- Verify adequate RAM allocation (minimum 2GB recommended)## üîß Auto-Start Options

- Check CPU core availability for process prioritization

- Ensure tmpfs mount is available for state storage### Option 1: Using .devcontainer (Recommended)

- Verify DNS resolution is functioning correctlyThe `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` will automatically:

- Install Tailscale on container creation

## License- Start Tailscale daemon when codespace starts



This project is provided as-is for educational and personal use. Please comply with Tailscale's terms of service and applicable local regulations.### Option 2: Manual Bashrc Addition

```bash

## Support# Add this line to ~/.bashrc for auto-start on terminal open

/workspaces/India-VPN/start-tailscale.sh

For issues related to:```

- **Tailscale Configuration**: Consult official Tailscale documentation

- **Network Optimization**: Review kernel documentation for TCP tuning### Option 3: GitHub Codespaces dotfiles

- **GitHub Codespaces**: Check GitHub Codespaces troubleshooting guidesAdd the startup command to your dotfiles repository.



---## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting



*Professional VPN solution for secure, high-performance India-based connectivity.*### If Tailscale isn't installed:
```bash
./setup-tailscale-codespace.sh
```

### Check daemon status:
```bash
./tailscale-service.sh status
```

### Manual connection:
```bash
sudo tailscale up
```

### View logs:
```bash
tail -f /tmp/tailscale-daemon.log
```

## üåê Usage

Once connected, you'll have access to your Tailscale network including any India-based resources, exit nodes, or subnet routes configured in your Tailnet.

Check your connection:
```bash
sudo tailscale status
```

## üìù Notes

- First connection requires authentication via the Tailscale web interface
- Container warnings (DNS, TPM) are normal and don't affect functionality
- The daemon runs in the background and survives terminal closures
- Use `tailscale down` to disconnect when done
