# Security and Privacy Guide

## What This VPN Protects You From

This VPN provides multiple layers of protection to keep your internet activity private and secure.

## What We Protect You From

### Internet Spying and Tracking
- **Your ISP** can't see what websites you visit
- **Government surveillance** is blocked by encryption
- **Hackers on public WiFi** can't intercept your data
- **Advertisers** can't track you across websites
- **Your location** appears as your chosen exit node location instead of your real location

### Ads and Malware
- **99% of web ads** are blocked before they load
- **Tracking cookies** are prevented from following you
- **Malicious websites** are blocked automatically
- **Mobile app ads** are blocked system-wide
- **Faster browsing** because ads don't need to download

### Data Collection
- **Social media tracking** (Facebook, Google, etc.) is blocked
- **Shopping websites** can't build profiles about you
- **Email tracking pixels** are blocked
- **Analytics companies** can't see your behavior
- **Your browsing history** stays completely private

## How It Works (Simple Explanation)

### 1. Encryption Tunnel
Think of it like a **secret tunnel** for your internet:
- All your data is scrambled (encrypted) before leaving your device
- Only the VPN exit node server can unscramble it
- Nobody in between can see what you're doing

### 2. Location Masking
The VPN makes you appear to be in your chosen exit location:
- Websites see your exit node IP address, not your real one
- You can access geo-restricted content from anywhere
- Your real location stays hidden

### 3. Ad and Tracker Blocking
Before websites even load, we block:
- Advertisement servers (no ads download)
- Tracking companies (they can't follow you)
- Malware domains (dangerous sites are unreachable)
- Social media trackers (Facebook, Google can't spy)

## Common Questions

### Is This Legal?
Yes! Using a VPN is legal in most countries. We use legitimate technology and don't store any logs of your activity.

### Will This Slow Down My Internet?
Actually, it often makes it faster because:
- Ads don't need to download (saves bandwidth)
- We optimize your network settings
- Trackers can't slow down page loading
- Most users see 2-4x faster browsing

### Can I Still Access My Local Services?
Yes! The VPN is designed to:
- Allow access to local network devices
- Let you use local services normally
- Only route internet traffic through chosen exit nodes
- Keep local connections working

### What About My Phone Apps?
The ad blocking works on:
- All websites in any browser
- Many mobile apps (system-wide blocking)
- Streaming apps like YouTube, Netflix
- Social media apps (blocks their tracking)

## Privacy Promise

### Encryption Technology
- **WireGuard protocol** with ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption
- **Perfect forward secrecy** - past communications stay secure even if keys are compromised

### Ad Blocking Technology
- **DNS sinkhole** - blocks ads at the network level before they load
- **Multiple blocklists** - combines several reputable ad/tracker databases
- **Real-time updates** - automatically gets new blocking rules
- **Minimal performance impact** - blocking happens before download starts

### Network Optimizations
- **BBR congestion control** - Google's advanced algorithm for better speeds
