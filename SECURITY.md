# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security features and configurations implemented in the India VPN solution.

## Base Security Features

### Encryption
- **WireGuard Protocol**: Industry-standard end-to-end encryption
- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: Device-to-device authentication required
- **Key Management**: Automated key rotation and secure key exchange

### Network Security
- **DNS over TLS**: Encrypted DNS queries to prevent eavesdropping
- **IP Leak Protection**: Comprehensive traffic routing through VPN tunnel
- **Kill Switch**: Automatic connection termination on VPN failure

## Security Profiles

### Standard Security
Default configuration with balanced security and performance:
- WireGuard encryption with ChaCha20-Poly1305
- Secure DNS resolution with DoT
- Basic kernel hardening parameters

### Enhanced Security Mode
Additional hardening measures for sensitive use cases:
- Kernel parameter hardening (IP forwarding restrictions)
- ICMP broadcast protection
- TCP SYN flood protection
- Strict reverse path filtering
- DNS query logging prevention

## Technical Implementation

### Network Stack Hardening
```bash
# IP forwarding restrictions
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects=0
net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects=0

# ICMP protection
net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts=1

# TCP security
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1
```

### DNS Security Configuration
- Primary: Cloudflare Security (1.1.1.2) with malware blocking
- Secondary: Quad9 (9.9.9.9) with threat intelligence
- Fallback: OpenDNS (208.67.222.2) with content filtering
- All queries encrypted using DNS over TLS

### Process Security
- Dedicated tmpfs storage for sensitive state data
- Process priority isolation
- Memory protection against buffer overflow attacks
- Restricted kernel log access

## Compliance Notes

This implementation follows industry best practices for:
- Network security hardening (CIS Benchmark compliance)
- DNS security (RFC 7858 - DNS over TLS)
- VPN security (RFC 4253 - Secure Shell Transport Layer)

## Audit Trail

All security-relevant events are logged including:
- VPN connection establishment and termination
- DNS resolution failures and security blocks
- Network configuration changes
- Process privilege escalations

*Security configurations are automatically applied based on selected operational profile.*

|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| ISP spying on Tailscale traffic | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| DNS query logging | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Browser fingerprinting | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Non-VPN traffic exposure | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Streaming throttling | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Video quality limitations | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

## 🎯 **Recommended Setup by Use Case**

### **General Browsing + Privacy**
```bash
./vpn secure
```

### **Maximum Anonymity**  
```bash
./vpn secure
./vpn proxy
```

### **4K Streaming (Netflix, YouTube, etc.)**
```bash
./vpn streaming
```

### **Everything Protected**
```bash
./vpn secure
./vpn proxy  
./vpn streaming
```

## 🔍 **How to Verify Your Protection**

### **Check IP and Location:**
```bash
curl https://ipapi.co/json | jq
```

### **Test DNS Security:**
```bash
dig @1.1.1.1 cloudflare.com
```

### **Test Streaming Speed:**
```bash
./vpn speed
```

### **Verify Proxy is Working:**
```bash
curl --proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:1080 https://ipapi.co/ip
```

## ⚡ **Performance Benchmarks**

| Configuration | Speed | Security | Streaming |
|---------------|-------|----------|-----------|
| Basic | 🟢 Fast | 🟡 Good | 🟡 HD |
| Secure | 🟢 Fast+ | 🟢 Excellent | 🟢 4K |
| Proxy | 🟡 Good | 🟢 Maximum | 🟢 4K |
| Streaming | 🟢 Optimized | 🟢 Excellent | 🟢 4K Ultra |

## 🚨 **Important Security Notes**

1. **Tailscale Key Security**: Keep your auth keys private
2. **Exit Node Trust**: Only use trusted devices as exit nodes
3. **Browser Updates**: Keep Chrome/Chromium updated
4. **Network Monitoring**: Use `./vpn speed` regularly

## 🛠️ **Quick Setup Commands**

```bash
# Full protection setup (recommended)
./vpn secure && ./vpn streaming

# Maximum anonymity
./vpn secure && ./vpn proxy

# Test everything is working
./vpn speed

# Check current protection level
./vpn status
```

## 🌍 **Server Locations Available**
Your Tailscale network can include exit nodes in:
- 🇮🇳 India (Current: Pune, Maharashtra)
- 🇺🇸 United States  
- 🇬🇧 United Kingdom
- 🇩🇪 Germany
- 🇸🇬 Singapore
- Any location where you have devices
